# Robot Vacuum Cleaner

This is small program I made as an example of Test Driven Development (TDD) in an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) fashion.

## Jest

I use Jest as test-runner, simply because that is what I've come to use daily in the past 3 years and I really like it.

## Node

This is a node application, because it doesn't need any graphical rendering and why make it more complicated than it has to be?

## OOP

I usually prefer functional style programming when I work in JavaScript and Frontend, but for this kind of assignment, it's like a standard scenario from when you learn OOP, so I find it fits very well with that kind of structure.
